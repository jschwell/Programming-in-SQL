# Programming-in-SQL
Programs created for the class Programming in SQL

## Lesson 1: Introduction to Relational Database Concepts and SQL Server Management Studio
**Objectives:**
* Introduction to SQL Server 2012 DBMS
* Summary of SQL Server 2012 tools

## Lesson 2: Retrieving Data from a Single Tables and Multiple Tables
**Objectives:**
* Code and run SELECT statements that use any of the language elements presented in this chapter
* Use the explicit syntax to code an inner join that returns data from a single table or multiple tables
* Code a union that combines data from a single table or multiple tables.

## Lesson 3: Summary Queries and Sub-Queries
**Objectives:**
* Code SELECT statements that require any of the language elements presented in this chapter
* Code SELECT statements that use common table expressions (CTEs) to define the subqueries

## Lesson 4: Data Maintenance / Data Types and Functions
**Objectives:**
* Given the specifications for an action query, code the INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement for doing the action
* Use the MERGE statement to merge rows from a source table into a target table
* Create a copy of a table by using the INTO clause of the SELECT statement
* Code queries that work with data types as well as queries that require any of the scalar functions presented in this chapter

## Lesson 5: Designing / Creating Database
**Objectives:**
* Given the specifications for a database modeled on a real-world system, design the database. Identify tables, columns, keys, relationships, and indexes for the new database
* Given a diagram for an unnormalized database, normalize the structure to the third normal form
* Given a complete database design, write the SQL DDL statements to create the database, including all tables, relationships, constraints, and indexes

## Lesson 6: Working with Views and Scripts
**Objectives:**
* Given a SELECT statement, create a new view based on the statement
* Given a SELECT statement, use the View Designer to create a new view based on the statement
* Use the View Designer to change the design of an existing view
* Given a Transact-SQL script written as a single batch, insert GO commands to divide the script into appropriate batches
* Given the specification for a database problem, write a script that solves it
* Use the SQLCMD utility to execute a query or a script

## Lesson 7: Stored Procedures and Triggers
**Objectives:**
* Given the specifications for a database problem, write a stored procedure that solves it
* Given a formula or expression, write a scalar-valued user-defined function based on the formula or expression
* Given a SELECT statement with a WHERE clause, write a table-valued user-defined function that replaces it
* Given the specifications for a database problem that could be caused by an action query, write a trigger that prevents the problem
* Given the specifications for a database problem that could be caused by a DDL statement, write a trigger that prevents the problem

## Lesson 8: Using Cursors
**Objectives:**
* Given the specifications for a database problem that can be solved by using Transact-SQL cursors, write a script that solves it

## Lesson 9: Manage Transaction Locking
**Objectives:**
* Given a set of statements to be combined into a transaction, insert the Transact-SQL statements to explicitly begin, commit, and roll back the transaction

## Lesson 10: How to manage database security
**Objectives:**
* Given the specifications for a new user’s security permissions, write the Transact-SQL statements that create the new user and grant the security permissions
* Given the specifications for a new user’s security permissions, use the Management Studio to create the new user and grant the security permissions
* Given the specifications for a set of security permissions, write the Transact-SQL statements to create a new role and assign users or groups to it
* Given the specifications for a set of security permissions, use the Management Studio to create a new role and assign users or groups to it
* Use system stored procedures or the Management Studio to add users to the fixed server roles or to add users and roles to the fixed database roles.
